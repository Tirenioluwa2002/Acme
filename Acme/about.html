            The strongest argument against a loving God is the
presence of human suffering. This truly helpful book brings
to this daunting subject a profound realism, a warm
sympathy and a deep Christian faith. Highly recommended!
In an extraordinary combination of argument and empathy,
Amy Orr-Ewing weaves together the Bible story of suffering
and her own experience as a woman, a wife, a mother, an
academic, a pastor and a friend. And this in turn enables her
to ask the reader, “What is your story so far?” Such a timely
book for these days of Covid-19.

            Right now I find myself working at home during a
government lockdown, in isolation with my family. The death
toll from COVID-19 climbs daily. We have all been shocked to
discover how vulnerable and helpless we are against a
microbial virus that has taken loved ones, closed borders,
shops and restaurants, and halted the economy of half the
planet. Where is God in the fear, suffering and grief of this
global pandemic?
